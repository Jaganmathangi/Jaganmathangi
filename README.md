**About Me**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jagan Mohan Mathangi, currently pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology at the University of Nottingham. With over 4 years of experience as a Research Associate and Team Lead in the fintech industry, I have developed a strong foundation in financial technology and research.

Iâ€™m passionate about data and technology and am currently building my skillset in SQL, Tableau, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statistics. My academic and professional journey is steering me towards becoming a Data Analyst or Data Scientist in a fast-paced fintech company in the UK.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on an SQL project, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing projects. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovative companies that value continuous learning and growth.
